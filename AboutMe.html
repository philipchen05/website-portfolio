        Hello,
        <br>
        <br>
        My name is Philip Chen. I am a grade ten student attending the MaCS program at William Lyon Mackenzie
        Collegiate Institute in Toronto, Ontario. I am a determined and hardworking student and I always strive for the
        best result possible. In my free time, I enjoy playing sports, going out with friends, and listening to music.
        My favourite sports are (association) football and basketball; basketball is my favourite sport to play while
        football is my favourite sport in general because I love its culture. Some of my favourite music artists
        include Drake, Lil Tjay, and Pressa.
        <br>
        <br>
        Outside of academics, I participate and have participated in many extracurricular activities including piano, competitive swimming, Royal Canadian Air Cadets, and numerous school sports teams. My longest-standing and most accomplished extracurricular is piano, for which I have received my Associate Diploma (ARCT), which is the second-highest academic standing awarded by the Royal Conservatory of Music Certificate Program. I have also completed all of my written music theory, history, harmony, and analysis requirements up to the ARCT level. From 2017-2019, I swam competitively with the ROC Clarington Swim Club and held the rank of Corporal in the 2 VandenBos Whitby Air Cadet Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets. Unfortunately, I had to put a hold on these activities due to the outbreak of the global pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, I was also a member of the soccer, volleyball, and cross country teams at my school.
        <br>
        <br>
        Aside from this, I also have a passion for volunteering in the community. Currently, I have
        amassed over 70 community service hours, a number which I plan on continuing to increase. I earned these hours
        from volunteering at a variety of events, including a church summer camp, the Toronto Waterfront Marathon, the
        Toronto Dragon Festival, and a Liberal MP election. Volunteering at these events has given me invaluable work
        experiences which I hope to further develop as I enter the workforce in the future.
        <br>
        <br>
        Along with my community service, my experience with work and making money has also helped better prepare me for
        my future work life. From the start of seventh grade to the end of eighth grade, I worked as a newspaper
        deliverer. My job was to package and deliver newspapers to my assigned newspaper route every Wednesday and
        Thursday, for which I received pay. Now that I no longer work in this position, I have taken up reselling
        coveted sneakers as a new way to make income.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sincerely,
        <br>
        <br>
