    <b>Learning Outside of ICS4U0</b>
    <br>
    My first experience with programming was in fourth grade when my teacher introduced me to Code.org's Hour of Code block-based coding tutorials. At the time, I was not as interested in computer science as I am today and I stayed away from programming for a while after fourth grade. In sixth grade, I was reintroduced to programming with Scratch, an introductory block-based visual programming language for beginner programmers. I became very enthusiastic about Scratch programming and spent a lot of time creating simple programs and games, including a falling fruit-catching game for my first genius hour project.

    <br>
    My first experience with authentic, text-based programming began halfway through sixth grade when I chose to learn JavaScript and create a simple JavaScript program for my second and final genius hour project of the year. All of my basic learning came from an online introductory JavaScript course on Codecademy and my final project was an interactive text-based age guessing game, where the program guesses the user's age based on user input to questions prompted by the program.

    In seventh grade, I chose to learn HTML and create a simple website for my first genius hour project. Once again, I learned from an introductory HTML course on Codecademy. The final completed website I created was an informative website on black bears; a topic inspired by the tutorials. After this project, I took a long break from programming again.

    In the summer of 2020, I took a virtual Python (3) course with Olympiads School, an enriched primary and secondary education services provider. The course consisted of sixteen two-hour classes spanned over two months (July and August). This was my first in-depth learning of a programming language and computer science in general (previous learning was very basic compared to this). In the course, I learned about Python's development history, the advantages of Python and how it simplifies programming for the programmer (such as automatically determining variable types based on assigned values), loops, lists, sets, dictionaries, functions, recursion, and more. Taking this Python course sparked a flame of great passion for computer science within me that continues to burn today.

    In late September 2020, I participated in my first MCPT (Mackenzie Computer Programming Team) ICS (Introduction to Computer Science) contest. One of the contest's requirements was to be able to get user input in Java. At the time of this contest, I was studying grade eleven Introduction to Computer Science (ICS3UP). All assignments in this course were done in the Ready to Program IDE, which features a unique Console class that can only be imported and used in Ready to Program. The Console class contains methods and variables that simplify Java console manipulations. For example, we were taught to get user string input using the readLine method in the Console class. However, the Console class cannot be accessed outside of Ready to Program, including in the MCPT ICS contest I was participating in. Therefore, I had to do individual research on how to get user input in standard (vanilla) Java.
    <br>
    <br>
    I learned that in standard Java, getting user input can be done in two main ways: by using the Scanner class or by using the BufferedReader class, both of which must be imported as neither are in the default Java library. I learned that each class has its pros and cons. The Scanner class has methods to read String objects and data of all primitive types while the BufferedReader class can only read strings. The Scanner class is also much simpler to implement in code. However, the BufferedReader class reads input much faster and more efficiently than the Scanner class. Having learned this information outside of my course, I was able to properly and correctly get user input in my MCPT ICS contest solutions, as well as in later MCPT ICS contests, LCCs (Lyon's Computing Contests), and the 2021 CCC (Canadian Computing Competition) written in February. As I continue to acquire more programming knowledge, I hope to continue to compete in computer science contests to further develop my skills as a programmer.
